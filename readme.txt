# Python Alarm Clock with GUI

This is a simple alarm clock application built in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

## Features

- Set alarms for specific times.
- Activate and deactivate alarms.
- Alarm sound playback (Windows only, using the `winsound` library).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (Download and install from [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- Tkinter (Included with most Python installations)
- Windows OS (for sound playback using `winsound`)

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the script using the following command:

4. The graphical interface will appear, allowing you to set and activate alarms.

## Usage

1. Enter the alarm time in the format `HH:MM AM/PM` (e.g., `08:30 AM`).

2. Click the "Set Alarm" button.

3. To activate the alarm, click the "Activate Alarm" button. The alarm will sound when the set time is reached.

4. To deactivate the alarm, click the "Deactivate Alarm" button.

## Notes

- The sound playback feature using `winsound` is specific to Windows. If you are using a different operating system, you may need to explore other sound playback libraries compatible with your platform.

- This code is a basic example, and you can enhance it by adding more features and improving the user interface as needed.
